## Kentucky Grandpa's Coffee Conundrum

As usual, Kentucky gets up bright and early and shuffles into the kitchen to make his cup of coffee. As he sips some hot java, he sits in front of his computer to check if he's gotten any new messages from his family. (It's a bad habit to look at a screen so early, but looks like everyone's been doing it lately. Kentucky doesn't want to be left out.) Suddenly he gets a notification: Your "Clean Coffee Machine" chore is due today! *Oh, I had completely forgotten*, thinks Kentucky. He clicks navigates to his chore app and looks at the top of the chore list, where he sees that he indeed needs to clean his coffee machine today. Kentucky gets up from his computer and walks over to get this chore over with... only to realize that he's also forgotten how to clean the coffee machine. (The last time he did it was 3 months ago.) Unpreturbed, he confidently walks back to his computer and clicks on the associated chore card. A pop up appears, on which is a handy list of instructions and materials needed to make his coffee machine sparkling clean! He gets what he needs and follows the steps carefully, and within 15 minutes he's done!
