- Hi! I am a third year Computer Engineering major and Psychology minor
- I am interested in Robotics, Automation systems and Animal Cognition. On a
  non-academic note, I love hiking and writing short fictional stories.
- One fun fact about me is that I love talking to animals, especially when
  volunteeing at animal shelters and endangered animal reserves (My profile
  picture is actually me at the "Free the Bears" Sanctuary in Cambodia).

- My name is Ojeen Gammah, I am a senior at UCSD and expected to graduate next fall with a B.S in Computer science. My interest lies in AI as well as autonomous vehicles. However, I am open to any area within the computer science field. I am most familiar with C++/Python/Java. In my extra time, I like to play tennis and soccer. I am very excited about this particular class because I have not done much agile method nor any harness test. Looking forward to this class. Please feel free to ask any question

- I’m Kevin Zhang, a third year undergraduate student majoring in Cognitive Science and Math-Computer Science. I’m interested in neuroscience, machine learning, and I’m also a Brain-Computer interface enthusiast. Moreover, I’m interested in software engineering, and I’m trying to figure out the principles that define a good software engineer in this class. Outside of academics, I love beatboxing, speedcubing, FPS gaming, and table tennis.
