  non-academic note, I love hiking and writing short fictional stories.

  volunteeing at animal shelters and endangered animal reserves (My profile

- Link to my personal Github: https://github.com/ojeengammah
- My name is Ojeen Gammah, I am a senior at UCSD and expected to graduate next fall with a B.S in Computer science. My interest lies in AI as well as autonomous vehicles. However, I am open to any area within the computer science field. I am most familiar with C++/Python/Java. In my extra time, I like to play tennis and soccer. I am very excited about this particular class because I have not done much agile method nor any harness test. Looking forward to this class. Please feel free to ask any question
