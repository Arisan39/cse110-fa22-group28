**Start + End Time: 2-2:35pm**

## Attendance
- Gagan
- Yash
- Neelay

## Agenda

- Clarify how complete the pitch needs to be by Tuesday
- Discuss project plan
- Ask about what needs to go into each user-centered thinking document

## Discussion

- What Gagan is looking for by Tuesday
  - Main pitch doc (pitch.md): statement of purpose, problem you're trying to solve, personas/user stories/use cases, rabbit holes
  - UI mockups: Turn whiteboard drawing into graphics, create separate flow chart
- ADRs not needed, but can be started
- Separate minimum viable features and possible future features
- Gagan's ideas for the apps
  - User page
  - Display amount of time it may take to _do_ a task
  - Notifications are doable
  - Leaderboard idea between roommates (with charts)
- Do some research about competing products
- Storing data
  - Can likely use MySQL (useful for dependencies between each other)
  - Can use json file or smth like MongoDB (better for data that has not many dependencies between each other)
- Sprints
  - How to divide time and tasks in Agile
  - Tasks initially stored in backlog
  - Assign subset of these tasks to be completed for a sprint
  - Complete and reevaluate
  - Have weekly sprints or 2 two week sprints with 1 final one week sprint
- We're on the right track for user stories and use cases
  - Assign user story to each persona
  - Not all personas/user stories need to be in pitch, but bring 2-3 over from the other docs
