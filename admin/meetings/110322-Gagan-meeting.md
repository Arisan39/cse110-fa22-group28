# Meeting Minutes Team 28 11/03/22

**Topic: Check-in with Gagan**

**Location: Zoom**

**Start + End Time: 12-12:25 PM**

## Attendance
- Gagan
- Yash
- Neelay

## Agenda

- Discuss progress
- Ask about running sprint planning meetings
- Ask about using code from labs

## Discussion

- Review of progress
  - Finished pitch docs
  - Beginning first sprint (repo setup, click-through flows and skeletons)
  - First sprint is short, from today to Sunday
  - Sprint planning today at 5, will also do mob coding
- Sprint info
  - weekly sprints, but not 100% set in stone
  - Will use time labels
- Git Flow modules
  - branching model: one central repository, multiple branches
  - possible branching models: trunk-based, 1 branch per dev, etc.
  - forking model: add intermediate fork between local repo and main repo (local --> fork --> main repo)
  - Suggestion: Make sure branch protections are strong enough
- Storage for App
  - We're planning on just using a json file
  - Browser's local storage is also an option (a bit more advanced)
  - Indexed DB: more powerful than local storage, built for running on browser (NoSQL with key-value pairs)
  - MySQL or some other NoSQL database (like MongoDB) also work, but it has a learning curve
- ADRs
  - Start working on this document
  - Will be more of a running document (likely a .md file)
  - Current decisions to add: why we chose this project, why we are prioritizing some features, why we have set up the repo the way we did
  - Doesn't need to be a "team lead only" doc
- Sprint Planning
  - As team leads, **we can make decisions of splitting up tasks ourselves**
  - During the meeting, **we assign the tasks**
- Lab code
  - Is it possible to use similar formats to the code provided on the labs?
  - Should be ok, since the labs are designed to help us in our projects
  - It's ok if some of our app's components are very similar to the labs
